2.  **Refine All Projects:** Focus on performance optimization, adding more complex scenarios, improving the AI's emotional intelligence, and comprehensive testing.

# Start Fresh


Of course. Let's start completely fresh and build a monorepo from scratch without using Nx. This approach gives you full control and a clear understanding of how the pieces fit together.

---

### **Step 1: Reset and Prepare the Environment**

1.  **Delete the Old Project:** If you have the `virtual-patient-platform` folder from the previous attempt, please delete it to ensure a clean start.

2.  **Create a New GitHub Repository:**
    *   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a **new, empty** repository named `virtual-patient-platform`.
    *   Do **not** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.
    *   Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-platform.git`).

---

### **Step 2: Initialize the Local Monorepo Structure**

1.  **Create the Project Folder and Connect to Git:**
    Open your terminal and run these commands:

    ```bash
    # Create and enter the project directory
    mkdir virtual-patient-platform
    cd virtual-patient-platform

    # Initialize Git
    git init

    # Connect to your remote GitHub repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-platform.git

    # Create the basic monorepo folder structure
    mkdir apps
    mkdir libs

    # Create a root package.json to manage the monorepo
    npm init -y
    ```

2.  **Configure the Root `package.json`:**
    Open the newly created `package.json` file in the root directory and modify it to enable NPM workspaces. This is the key to making our monorepo work.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "virtual-patient-platform",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A comprehensive virtual patient training platform.",
      "private": true,
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "workspaces": [
        "apps/*",
        "libs/*"
      ],
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```
    The `"workspaces"` array tells NPM that the `apps` and `libs` folders contain sub-projects that should be managed together.

3.  **Initial Commit:**
    Let's commit this basic structure.

    ```bash
    # Create a simple README
    echo "# Virtual Patient Platform" > README.md

    # Stage and commit
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Initialize monorepo structure with workspaces"

    # Push to GitHub
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

---

### **Step 3: Create Project 1 - Core API & User Service**

Now, we'll create our first application inside the `apps` folder.

1.  **Generate the NestJS API App:**
    From the **root** of your monorepo, run the NestJS CLI command and tell it to create the project inside the `apps/api` directory.

    ```bash
    # This creates a new NestJS project in the 'apps/api' folder
    nest new api --directory apps/api --package-manager npm
    ```
    When prompted for a description, you can just press Enter.

2.  **Install API Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the new API directory and install the packages we need.

    ```bash
    cd apps/api

    npm install @nestjs/config @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport @prisma/client bcrypt class-transformer class-validator passport passport-jwt passport-local
    npm install --save-dev @types/bcrypt @types/passport-jwt @types/passport-local prisma

    # Navigate back to the root
    cd ../..
    ```

---

### **Step 4: Implement the API Authentication**

The code for the API implementation is the same as before, but the file paths are now different. We will work inside the `apps/api` folder.

#### **A. Database Setup with Prisma**

1.  **Initialize Prisma:**
    ```bash
    cd apps/api
    npx prisma init
    cd ../..
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Open `apps/api/.env` and add your credentials.

    ```env
    # apps/api/.env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
    ```

3.  **Define the Database Schema:**
    Open `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` and add the models.

    ```prisma
    // apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model Role {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      name      String   @unique
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      users     User[]
    }

    model User {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      email     String   @unique
      password  String
      firstName String
      lastName  String
      isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      roleId    Int
      role      Role     @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])
    }
    ```

4.  **Generate Client & Migrate:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
    npx prisma db push --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
    ```

#### **B. Code Implementation**

Create the following files and folders inside `apps/api/src/`. You can use the NestJS CLI to generate modules/services/controllers, or create them manually.

*   `src/app/prisma.service.ts` (for the database connection)
*   `src/auth/auth.module.ts`
*   `src/auth/auth.service.ts`
*   `src/auth/auth.controller.ts`
*   `src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`
*   `src/auth/strategies/local.strategy.ts`
*   `src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`
*   `src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`
*   `src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts`
*   `src/auth/roles.decorator.ts`

*(Copy the code for each of these files from the very first guide. The file contents are identical, only their location within `apps/api/` has changed).*

#### **C. Update Main App Module**

Open `apps/api/src/app.module.ts` and import the `AuthModule`.

```typescript
// apps/api/src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';
import { PrismaService } from './app/prisma.service';

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService, PrismaService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### **D. Seed Script**

Create `apps/api/prisma/seed.ts` and add the seeding code. Add the seed script to `apps/api/package.json` and run it.

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run seed
cd ../..
```

---

### **Step 5: Create a Shared Library for Types**

To demonstrate the power of the monorepo, let's create a library for types that both the API and future frontend can use.

1.  **Create the Library Folder and `package.json`:**
    ```bash
    mkdir libs/shared-types
    cd libs/shared-types
    npm init -y
    cd ../..
    ```
    Edit `libs/shared-types/package.json` and give it a name and a build script.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "@virtual-patient-platform/shared-types",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Shared TypeScript types for the platform.",
      "main": "dist/index.js",
      "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```

2.  **Create a TypeScript Config for the Library:**
    Create `libs/shared-types/tsconfig.json`.

    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "declaration": true,
        "outDir": "./dist",
        "rootDir": "./src"
      },
      "include": ["src/**/*"]
    }
    ```

3.  **Add a Shared Type:**
    Create `libs/shared-types/src/index.ts` and export a type.

    ```typescript
    // libs/shared-types/src/index.ts
    export interface User {
      id: number;
      email: string;
      firstName: string;
      lastName: string;
      role: string;
    }
    ```

4.  **Link the Library to the API:**
    From the **root** of the monorepo, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `workspaces` in the root `package.json` and symlinks everything together. Now, you can install your local library into the API project:
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm install @virtual-patient-platform/shared-types --workspace=apps/api
    ```
    This adds the shared types library as a dependency to the API's `package.json`.

---

### **Step 6: Run, Test, and Push to GitHub**

1.  **Run the API Server:**
    From the **root** of the monorepo, you can run scripts in any workspace.

    ```bash
    # Run the API application
    npm run start:dev --workspace=apps/api
    ```
    The API will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Test the Endpoints:**
    Use Postman or `curl` to test the auth endpoints.

3.  **Commit and Push Your Work:**
    Your first project is complete. Let's commit everything to GitHub.

    ```bash
    # Stage all your changes
    git add .

    # Commit with a descriptive message
    git commit -m "feat: Implement Project 1 - Core API & User Service with Auth

    - Set up monorepo with apps/api and libs/shared-types
    - Implement JWT-based authentication with roles
    - Add Prisma for database management
    - Add shared types library"

    # Push to the remote repository
    git push origin main
    ```

You have now successfully built a monorepo from scratch, without Nx, and completed the first project. You have a solid foundation for adding the next project (the frontend client) to this same repository.

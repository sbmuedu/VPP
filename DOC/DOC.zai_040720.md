# Project Steps

Of course. Based on the proposal, here is a practical, step-by-step programming plan. The work is divided into logical, manageable projects that can be developed in sequence, with some potential for parallel work.

This approach treats each major component as a distinct "project" with its own goals, technologies, and responsibilities.

---

## **Project Breakdown & Implementation Plan**

Here are the eight core projects that, when combined, will form the complete Virtual Patient Training Platform.

- **Purpose:** To provide an immersive, visual representation of the patient that reflects their current physiological state.
- **Core Technologies:** React Three Fiber (R3F), Three.js, Next.js, TypeScript.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Integrate R3F into the Next.js application.
  - Source or create a base 3D human model.
  - Use React state to drive the 3D model's animations (e.g., breathing rate, skin color, facial expressions) based on real-time data from the Scenario Engine.
  - Develop simple interactions, like clicking on a body part to examine it.
- **Dependencies:** Project 7 (Web Client Application, for integration) and Project 3 (Scenario Engine, for state data).

---

## **Step-by-Step Implementation Workflow**

Here is the recommended order to tackle these projects, aligning with the original proposal's phases.

**Step 1: Build the Foundation (Month 1)**

1.  **Start Project 1: Core API & User Service.** Get the database, authentication, and basic API running.
2.  **Start Project 7: Web Client Application.** Build the shell: login, registration, and a basic dashboard that can communicate with the Core API.
3.  **Start Project 2: Medical Knowledge Base Service.** Begin building the data models and API endpoints for drugs and tests.

2.  **Refine All Projects:** Focus on performance optimization, adding more complex scenarios, improving the AI's emotional intelligence, and comprehensive testing.

# Start Fresh

Of course. Let's start completely fresh and build a monorepo from scratch without using Nx. This approach gives you full control and a clear understanding of how the pieces fit together.

---

### **Step 1: Reset and Prepare the Environment**

1.  **Delete the Old Project:** If you have the `virtual-patient-platform` folder from the previous attempt, please delete it to ensure a clean start.

2.  **Create a New GitHub Repository:**
    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a **new, empty** repository named `virtual-patient-platform`.
    - Do **not** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.
    - Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-platform.git`).

---

### **Step 2: Initialize the Local Monorepo Structure**

1.  **Create the Project Folder and Connect to Git:**
    Open your terminal and run these commands:

    ```bash
    # Create and enter the project directory
    mkdir virtual-patient-platform
    cd virtual-patient-platform

    # Initialize Git
    git init

    # Connect to your remote GitHub repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-platform.git

    # Create the basic monorepo folder structure
    mkdir apps
    mkdir libs

    # Create a root package.json to manage the monorepo
    npm init -y
    ```

2.  **Configure the Root `package.json`:**
    Open the newly created `package.json` file in the root directory and modify it to enable NPM workspaces. This is the key to making our monorepo work.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "virtual-patient-platform",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A comprehensive virtual patient training platform.",
      "private": true,
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "workspaces": ["apps/*", "libs/*"],
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```

    The `"workspaces"` array tells NPM that the `apps` and `libs` folders contain sub-projects that should be managed together.

3.  **Initial Commit:**
    Let's commit this basic structure.

    ```bash
    # Create a simple README
    echo "# Virtual Patient Platform" > README.md

    # Stage and commit
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Initialize monorepo structure with workspaces"

    # Push to GitHub
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

---

### **Step 3: Create Project 1 - Core API & User Service**

Now, we'll create our first application inside the `apps` folder.

1.  **Generate the NestJS API App:**
    From the **root** of your monorepo, run the NestJS CLI command and tell it to create the project inside the `apps/api` directory.

    ```bash
    # This creates a new NestJS project in the 'apps/api' folder
    nest new api --directory apps/api --package-manager npm
    ```

    When prompted for a description, you can just press Enter.

2.  **Install API Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the new API directory and install the packages we need.

    ```bash
    cd apps/api

    npm install @nestjs/config @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport @prisma/client bcrypt class-transformer class-validator passport passport-jwt passport-local
    npm install --save-dev @types/bcrypt @types/passport-jwt @types/passport-local prisma

    # Navigate back to the root
    cd ../..
    ```

---

### **Step 4: Implement the API Authentication**

The code for the API implementation is the same as before, but the file paths are now different. We will work inside the `apps/api` folder.

#### **A. Database Setup with Prisma**

1.  **Initialize Prisma:**
    ```bash
    cd apps/api
    npx prisma init
    cd ../..
    ```

after running 'npx prisma init' output is:

```Text
     Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

warn You already have a .gitignore file. Don't forget to add `.env` in it to not commit any private information.

Next steps:
1. Run prisma dev to start a local Prisma Postgres server.
2. Define models in the schema.prisma file.
3. Run prisma migrate dev to migrate your local Prisma Postgres database.
4. Tip: Explore how you can extend the ORM with scalable connection pooling, global caching, and a managed serverless Postgres database. Read: https://pris.ly/cli/beyond-orm

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Open `apps/api/.env` and add your credentials.

    ```env
    # apps/api/.env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
    ```

3.  **Define the Database Schema:**
    Open `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` and add the models.

    ```prisma
    // apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model Role {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      name      String   @unique
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      users     User[]
    }

    model User {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      email     String   @unique
      password  String
      firstName String
      lastName  String
      isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      roleId    Int
      role      Role     @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])
    }
    ```

4.  **Generate Client & Migrate:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
    npx prisma db push --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
    ```

#### **B. Code Implementation**

Create the following files and folders inside `apps/api/src/`. You can use the NestJS CLI to generate modules/services/controllers, or create them manually.

- `src/app/prisma.service.ts` (for the database connection)
- `src/auth/auth.module.ts`
- `src/auth/auth.service.ts`
- `src/auth/auth.controller.ts`
- `src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`
- `src/auth/strategies/local.strategy.ts`
- `src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`
- `src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`
- `src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts`
- `src/auth/roles.decorator.ts`
  cd app/api/src
  mkdir auth
  mkdir app
  mkdir auth/dto
  mkdir auth/strategies
  mkdir auth/guards

cd ..

touch src/app/prisma.service.ts
touch src/auth/auth.module.ts
touch src/auth/auth.service.ts
touch src/auth/auth.controller.ts
touch src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts
touch src/auth/strategies/local.strategy.ts
touch src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts
touch src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts
touch src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts
touch src/auth/roles.decorator.ts

_(Copy the code for each of these files from the very first guide. The file contents are identical, only their location within `apps/api/` has changed)._

#### **C. Update Main App Module**

Open `apps/api/src/app.module.ts` and import the `AuthModule`.

```typescript
// apps/api/src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AppController } from "./app.controller";
import { AppService } from "./app.service";
import { AuthModule } from "./auth/auth.module";
import { PrismaService } from "./app/prisma.service";

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService, PrismaService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### **D. Seed Script**

Create `apps/api/prisma/seed.ts` and add the seeding code. Add the seed script to `apps/api/package.json` and run it.

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run seed
cd ../..
```

---

### **Step 5: Create a Shared Library for Types**

To demonstrate the power of the monorepo, let's create a library for types that both the API and future frontend can use.

1.  **Create the Library Folder and `package.json`:**

    ```bash
    mkdir libs/shared-types
    cd libs/shared-types
    npm init -y
    cd ../..
    ```

    Edit `libs/shared-types/package.json` and give it a name and a build script.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "@virtual-patient-platform/shared-types",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Shared TypeScript types for the platform.",
      "main": "dist/index.js",
      "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```

2.  **Create a TypeScript Config for the Library:**
    Create `libs/shared-types/tsconfig.json`.

    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "declaration": true,
        "outDir": "./dist",
        "rootDir": "./src"
      },
      "include": ["src/**/*"]
    }
    ```

3.  **Add a Shared Type:**
    Create `libs/shared-types/src/index.ts` and export a type.

    ```typescript
    // libs/shared-types/src/index.ts
    export interface User {
      id: number;
      email: string;
      firstName: string;
      lastName: string;
      role: string;
    }
    ```

4.  **Link the Library to the API:**
    From the **root** of the monorepo, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `workspaces` in the root `package.json` and symlinks everything together. Now, you can install your local library into the API project:
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm install @virtual-patient-platform/shared-types --workspace=apps/api
    ```
    This adds the shared types library as a dependency to the API's `package.json`.

---

### **Step 6: Run, Test, and Push to GitHub**

1.  **Run the API Server:**
    From the **root** of the monorepo, you can run scripts in any workspace.

    ```bash
    # Run the API application
    npm run start:dev --workspace=apps/api
    ```

    The API will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Test the Endpoints:**
    Use Postman or `curl` to test the auth endpoints.

3.  **Commit and Push Your Work:**
    Your first project is complete. Let's commit everything to GitHub.

    ```bash
    # Stage all your changes
    git add .

    # Commit with a descriptive message
    git commit -m "feat: Implement Project 1 - Core API & User Service with Auth

    - Set up monorepo with apps/api and libs/shared-types
    - Implement JWT-based authentication with roles
    - Add Prisma for database management
    - Add shared types library"

    # Push to the remote repository
    git push origin main
    ```

You have now successfully built a monorepo from scratch, without Nx, and completed the first project. You have a solid foundation for adding the next project (the frontend client) to this same repository.

# -Auth

You are absolutely right to point that out. My apologies, it seems the file creation steps may have been unclear or an error occurred during the process. An empty file will cause the exact errors you're seeing.

Let's fix this right now. We will create the files with the correct content in the correct locations.

The key is that the `auth` module and the `prisma.service` should be located **inside** the `apps/api/src/app/` directory.

---

### **Step 1: Verify File Locations**

First, please check your file explorer. You should have the following structure inside `apps/api/src/`:

```
apps/api/src/
├── app/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── dto/
│   │   ├── guards/
│   │   ├── strategies/
│   │   ├── auth.controller.ts
│   │   ├── auth.module.ts
│   │   └── auth.service.ts
│   ├── app.controller.ts
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── app.service.ts
│   └── prisma.service.ts  <-- This should be here
├── main.ts
└── ...
```

If the folders or files are missing or in the wrong place, follow the steps below to create them correctly.

---

### **Step 2: Create the `PrismaService`**

This file is a dependency for the `AuthModule`, so we'll create it first.

**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/prisma.service.ts`

```typescript
// apps/api/src/app/prisma.service.ts
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from "@nestjs/common";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

@Injectable()
export class PrismaService extends PrismaClient implements OnModuleInit {
  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.$connect();
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Create the `AuthModule` and its Dependencies**

Now, let's create all the files for the authentication module. If the folders `auth`, `auth/dto`, `auth/guards`, and `auth/strategies` do not exist, please create them inside `apps/api/src/app/`.

**A. Auth DTO (Data Transfer Object)**
**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`

```typescript
import { IsEmail, IsString, MinLength, IsOptional } from "class-validator";

export class RegisterDto {
  @IsEmail()
  email: string;

  @IsString()
  @MinLength(6)
  password: string;

  @IsString()
  firstName: string;

  @IsString()
  lastName: string;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsString()
  roleName?: string; // e.g., 'student'
}
```

**B. Auth Service**
**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.service.ts`

```typescript
import {
  Injectable,
  UnauthorizedException,
  ConflictException,
} from "@nestjs/common";
import { JwtService } from "@nestjs/jwt";
import { PrismaService } from "../prisma.service";
import * as bcrypt from "bcrypt";
import { RegisterDto } from "./dto/register.dto";

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(
    private prisma: PrismaService,
    private jwtService: JwtService,
  ) {}

  async validateUser(email: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { email },
      include: { role: true },
    });
    if (user && (await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password))) {
      // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
      const { password, ...result } = user;
      return result;
    }
    return null;
  }

  async login(user: any) {
    const payload = { email: user.email, sub: user.id, role: user.role.name };
    return {
      access_token: this.jwtService.sign(payload),
      user: {
        id: user.id,
        email: user.email,
        firstName: user.firstName,
        lastName: user.lastName,
        role: user.role.name,
      },
    };
  }

  async register(registerDto: RegisterDto) {
    const {
      email,
      password,
      firstName,
      lastName,
      roleName = "student",
    } = registerDto;

    const existingUser = await this.prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { email },
    });
    if (existingUser) {
      throw new ConflictException("Email already in use");
    }

    const role = await this.prisma.role.findUnique({
      where: { name: roleName },
    });
    if (!role) {
      throw new ConflictException(`Role '${roleName}' not found`);
    }

    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

    const user = await this.prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email,
        password: hashedPassword,
        firstName,
        lastName,
        roleId: role.id,
      },
      include: { role: true },
    });

    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
    const { password: _, ...result } = user;
    return result;
  }
}
```

**C. Auth Strategies**
**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/strategies/local.strategy.ts`

```typescript
import { Strategy } from "passport-local";
import { PassportStrategy } from "@nestjs/passport";
import { Injectable, UnauthorizedException } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthService } from "../auth.service";

@Injectable()
export class LocalStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {
    super({ usernameField: "email" });
  }

  async validate(email: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.authService.validateUser(email, password);
    if (!user) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return user;
  }
}
```

**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`

```typescript
import { ExtractJwt, Strategy } from "passport-jwt";
import { PassportStrategy } from "@nestjs/passport";
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ConfigService } from "@nestjs/config";

@Injectable()
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(configService: ConfigService) {
    super({
      jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
      ignoreExpiration: false,
      secretOrKey: configService.get<string>("JWT_SECRET"),
    });
  }

  async validate(payload: any) {
    return { userId: payload.sub, email: payload.email, role: payload.role };
  }
}
```

**D. Auth Guards**
**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthGuard } from "@nestjs/passport";

@Injectable()
export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard("jwt") {}
```

**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts`

```typescript
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Reflector } from "@nestjs/core";

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private reflector: Reflector) {}

  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const requiredRoles = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride<string[]>("roles", [
      context.getHandler(),
      context.getClass(),
    ]);
    if (!requiredRoles) {
      return true;
    }
    const { user } = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return requiredRoles.some((role) => user.role === role);
  }
}
```

**E. Roles Decorator**
**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/roles.decorator.ts`

```typescript
import { SetMetadata } from "@nestjs/common";

export const ROLES_KEY = "roles";
export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata(ROLES_KEY, roles);
```

**F. Auth Controller**
**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.controller.ts`

```typescript
import {
  Controller,
  Post,
  Body,
  UseGuards,
  Request,
  Get,
} from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";
import { RegisterDto } from "./dto/register.dto";
import { LocalAuthGuard } from "./guards/local-auth.guard";
import { JwtAuthGuard } from "./guards/jwt-auth.guard";
import { Roles } from "./roles.decorator";
import { RolesGuard } from "./guards/roles.guard";

@Controller("auth")
export class AuthController {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {}

  @Post("register")
  async register(@Body() registerDto: RegisterDto) {
    return this.authService.register(registerDto);
  }

  @UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
  @Post("login")
  async login(@Request() req) {
    return this.authService.login(req.user);
  }

  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  @Get("profile")
  getProfile(@Request() req) {
    return req.user;
  }

  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
  @Roles("admin", "supervisor")
  @Get("admin/dashboard")
  getAdminDashboard() {
    return { message: "Welcome to the admin dashboard!" };
  }
}
```

**G. Auth Module File (The main one)**
**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.module.ts`

```typescript
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";
import { AuthController } from "./auth.controller";
import { PrismaService } from "../prisma.service";
import { JwtModule } from "@nestjs/jwt";
import { PassportModule } from "@nestjs/passport";
import { ConfigModule, ConfigService } from "@nestjs/config";
import { LocalStrategy } from "./strategies/local.strategy";
import { JwtStrategy } from "./strategies/jwt.strategy";

@Module({
  imports: [
    PassportModule,
    JwtModule.registerAsync({
      imports: [ConfigModule],
      useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
        secret: configService.get<string>("JWT_SECRET"),
        signOptions: { expiresIn: "1d" },
      }),
      inject: [ConfigService],
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AuthController],
  providers: [AuthService, PrismaService, LocalStrategy, JwtStrategy],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

---

### **Step 4: Correct the `app.module.ts`**

Finally, ensure your main `app.module.ts` file has the correct imports.

**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/app.module.ts`

```typescript
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AppController } from "./app.controller";
import { AppService } from "./app.service";
import { AuthModule } from "./auth/auth.module";
import { PrismaService } from "./prisma.service";

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService, PrismaService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Fix**

Now, try to run the API server again from the root directory:

```bash
npm run start:dev --workspace=apps/api
```

The compilation errors should be gone, and the server should start successfully. You can now proceed with testing the endpoints and running the frontend client as described in the previous steps. My apologies again for the confusion, and thank you for catching it

You are absolutely right! My sincere apologies. I provided the import for `LocalAuthGuard` in the controller but completely forgot to provide the code for the file itself. Thank you for catching this so quickly.

Let's create the missing file right now.

---

### **Create the Missing `LocalAuthGuard`**

**File Path:** `apps/api/src/app/auth/guards/local-auth.guard.ts`

If the `guards` folder doesn't exist inside `apps/api/src/app/auth/`, please create it first. Then, create the file `local-auth.guard.ts` inside it and add the following code:

```typescript
// apps/api/src/app/auth/guards/local-auth.guard.ts
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthGuard } from "@nestjs/passport";

@Injectable()
export class LocalAuthGuard extends AuthGuard("local") {}
```

This guard is very simple. It tells NestJS to use the Passport strategy we named `'local'` (which we defined in `local.strategy.ts`) to protect the route.

---

### **Verify the Fix**

Now that the file exists, the import statement in your `auth.controller.ts` will resolve correctly.

Try running the API server again from the **root** directory:

```bash
npm run start:dev --workspace=apps/api
```

The error should now be gone, and your server should start without any issues. You can now proceed with testing the full authentication flow with your frontend client.

Thank you again for your patience and for helping to make this guide accurate

# Web---

Excellent. With the backend authentication service in place, the next logical step is to create the user-facing application. This will be **Project 7: Web Client Application**. We will build this with Next.js to have a complete, working front-end and back-end loop as soon as possible.

---

### **Project 7: Web Client Application (Frontend)**

### **Objective**

Create a modern, responsive web application using Next.js that will serve as the primary interface for students and supervisors. This initial version will focus on user authentication (registration, login) and the main dashboard.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** Zustand (simple, fast, and scalable)
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod for validation

---

### **Step 1: Create the Next.js Application**

From the **root** of your monorepo, run the following command to create a new Next.js app inside the `apps` folder.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest client --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --no-git
```

This command does the following:

- Creates the app in a new folder named `client`.
- Enables TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint.
- Uses the new App Router.
- Organizes code inside a `src/` directory.
- Sets up a path alias (`@/*`) for easy imports.

Now, move the created app into our monorepo structure:

```bash
# Move the created folder into our 'apps' directory
mv client apps/
```

---

### **Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies**

Navigate into the new client app and install the necessary libraries.

```bash
cd apps/client

# Install state management, http client, and form libraries
npm install axios zustand react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod

# Install the shared types library from our monorepo
npm install @virtual-patient-platform/shared-types

# Navigate back to the root
cd ../..
```

By installing `@virtual-patient-platform/shared-types`, we can now use the `User` interface we defined earlier in our frontend code, ensuring type safety across the entire stack.

---

### **Step 3: Configure the Frontend Environment**

Create an environment file for the frontend to store the API URL.

**`apps/client/.env.local`**

```env
# The URL of our backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

_Note: Variables in Next.js that are available in the browser must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.\_

---

### **Step 4: Set Up Authentication State Management**

We'll use Zustand to manage the user's authentication state globally across the application.

1.  **Create the Auth Store:**
    Create a new folder `apps/client/src/stores` and add a file `authStore.ts`.

    **`apps/client/src/stores/authStore.ts`**

    ```typescript
    import { create } from "zustand";
    import { persist } from "zustand/middleware";
    import { User } from "@virtual-patient-platform/shared-types";

    interface AuthState {
      user: User | null;
      token: string | null;
      isAuthenticated: boolean;
      setAuth: (user: User, token: string) => void;
      logout: () => void;
    }

    export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>()(
      persist(
        (set) => ({
          user: null,
          token: null,
          isAuthenticated: false,
          setAuth: (user, token) => set({ user, token, isAuthenticated: true }),
          logout: () =>
            set({ user: null, token: null, isAuthenticated: false }),
        }),
        {
          name: "auth-storage", // name of the item in localStorage
        },
      ),
    );
    ```

---

### **Step 5: Create API Service Functions**

Create a dedicated service to handle all communication with the backend API.

1.  **Create an Axios Instance:**
    Create `apps/client/src/services/api.ts`. This instance will automatically include the JWT in headers for authenticated requests.

    **`apps/client/src/services/api.ts`**

    ```typescript
    import axios from "axios";
    import { useAuthStore } from "@/stores/authStore";

    const api = axios.create({
      baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
    });

    // Request interceptor to add the token to the headers
    api.interceptors.request.use(
      (config) => {
        const token = useAuthStore.getState().token;
        if (token) {
          config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
        }
        return config;
      },
      (error) => {
        return Promise.reject(error);
      },
    );

    export default api;
    ```

2.  **Create Auth Service:**
    Create `apps/client/src/services/authService.ts`.

    **`apps/client/src/services/authService.ts`**

    ```typescript
    import api from "./api";
    import { User } from "@virtual-patient-platform/shared-types";

    export interface LoginCredentials {
      email: string;
      password: string;
    }

    export interface RegisterData extends LoginCredentials {
      firstName: string;
      lastName: string;
    }

    export interface AuthResponse {
      access_token: string;
      user: User;
    }

    export const authService = {
      login: async (credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AuthResponse> => {
        const response = await api.post("/auth/login", credentials);
        return response.data;
      },

      register: async (data: RegisterData): Promise<User> => {
        const response = await api.post("/auth/register", data);
        return response.data;
      },

      getProfile: async (): Promise<User> => {
        const response = await api.get("/auth/profile");
        return response.data;
      },
    };
    ```

---

### **Step 6: Build the UI Pages**

Now we'll create the pages for registration, login, and the dashboard.

1.  **Registration Page:**
    Create `apps/client/src/app/register/page.tsx`.

    **`apps/client/src/app/register/page.tsx`**

    ```typescript
    'use client';

    import { useState } from 'react';
    { /* ... other imports */ }
    import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
    import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
    import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
    import { z } from 'zod';
    import { authService } from '@/services/authService';
    import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/authStore';

    const schema = z.object({
      email: z.string().email(),
      password: z.string().min(6),
      firstName: z.string().min(1),
      lastName: z.string().min(1),
    });

    type RegisterForm = z.infer<typeof schema>;

    export default function RegisterPage() {
      const router = useRouter();
      const setAuth = useAuthStore((state) => state.setAuth);
      const [error, setError] = useState('');
      const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

      const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<RegisterForm>({
        resolver: zodResolver(schema),
      });

      const onSubmit = async (data: RegisterForm) => {
        setIsLoading(true);
        setError('');
        try {
          // First, register the user
          await authService.register(data);

          // Then, log them in to get the token
          const loginResponse = await authService.login({ email: data.email, password: data.password });
          setAuth(loginResponse.user, loginResponse.access_token);

          router.push('/dashboard');
        } catch (err: any) {
          setError(err.response?.data?.message || 'An error occurred during registration.');
        } finally {
          setIsLoading(false);
        }
      };

      return (
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
          <div className="p-8 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md w-96">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Register</h2>
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-4">
              {/* ... form fields for firstName, lastName, email, password ... */}
              {/* Use register(...), errors, and isLoading from the hooks */}
              <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading} className="w-full bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded">
                {isLoading ? 'Registering...' : 'Register'}
              </button>
              {error && <p className="text-red-500 text-center">{error}</p>}
            </form>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

2.  **Login Page:**
    Create `apps/client/src/app/login/page.tsx`. This will be very similar to the register page.

    **`apps/client/src/app/login/page.tsx`**

    ```typescript
    'use client';

    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
    import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
    import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
    import { z } from 'zod';
    import { authService, LoginCredentials } from '@/services/authService';
    import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/authStore';

    const schema = z.object({
      email: z.string().email(),
      password: z.string().min(1),
    });

    export default function LoginPage() {
      const router = useRouter();
      const setAuth = useAuthStore((state) => state.setAuth);
      const [error, setError] = useState('');
      const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

      const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<LoginCredentials>({
        resolver: zodResolver(schema),
      });

      const onSubmit = async (data: LoginCredentials) => {
        setIsLoading(true);
        setError('');
        try {
          const response = await authService.login(data);
          setAuth(response.user, response.access_token);
          router.push('/dashboard');
        } catch (err: any) {
          setError(err.response?.data?.message || 'Invalid credentials.');
        } finally {
          setIsLoading(false);
        }
      };

      return (
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
          <div className="p-8 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md w-96">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Login</h2>
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-4">
              {/* ... form fields for email and password ... */}
              <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading} className="w-full bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded">
                {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}
              </button>
              {error && <p className="text-red-500 text-center">{error}</p>}
            </form>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

3.  **Dashboard Page:**
    Create `apps/client/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

    **`apps/client/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**

    ```typescript
    'use client';

    import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/authStore';

    export default function DashboardPage() {
      const { user, logout } = useAuthStore();

      const handleLogout = () => {
        logout();
        window.location.href = '/login';
      };

      if (!user) {
        // Optionally, show a loading spinner or redirect
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
      }

      return (
        <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100 p-8">
          <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Welcome, {user.firstName}!</h1>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">This is your dashboard.</p>
            <div className="mt-4">
              <p><strong>Email:</strong> {user.email}</p>
              <p><strong>Role:</strong> {user.role}</p>
            </div>
            <button onClick={handleLogout} className="mt-6 bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
              Logout
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

---

### **Step 7: Run and Test the Full-Stack Application**

1.  **Start the Backend API:**
    In one terminal, from the **root** directory:

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev --workspace=apps/api
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    In a second terminal, from the **root** directory:

    ```bash
    npm run dev --workspace=apps/client
    ```

    The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3001` (Next.js will automatically pick an available port if 3000 is taken).

3.  **Test the Flow:**
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/register`.
    - Create a new account.
    - You should be automatically redirected to the dashboard.
    - Log out and try logging back in.

### **Step 8: Commit and Push Your Work**

You have now successfully built a full-stack authentication loop! Let's save this major milestone.

```bash
# Stage all your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Implement Project 7 - Web Client Application

- Add Next.js app with Tailwind CSS
- Implement Zustand for global auth state management
- Create Login, Register, and Dashboard pages
- Integrate with backend API for authentication
- Add shared types library for type safety"

# Push to the remote repository
git push origin main
```

You now have a solid, working foundation. The next steps will be to build out the backend services (like the Medical Knowledge Base and Scenario Engine) and then create the UI in the client to interact with them.

2.  **Refine All Projects:** Focus on performance optimization, adding more complex scenarios, improving the AI's emotional intelligence, and comprehensive testing.

# Start Fresh
Of course. Starting fresh with a well-structured monorepo is an excellent approach. Let's build the foundation from scratch, connect it to GitHub, and then add our first project.

---

### **Step 1: Prerequisites & GitHub Setup**

1.  **Install Tools:** Make sure you have the following installed:
    *   **Node.js** (v18 or later)
    *   **Git**
    *   **NestJS CLI:** `npm install -g @nestjs/cli`

2.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    *   Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
    *   Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository".
    *   Name it `virtual-patient-platform`.
    *   **Crucially, do NOT** check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license". We want it completely empty.
    *   Click "Create repository".
    *   GitHub will show you a page with quick setup options. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-platform.git`). You will need it in a moment.

---

### **Step 2: Initialize the Local Monorepo**

1.  **Create the Project Folder:** Open your terminal and create a new folder for your project.

    ```bash
    mkdir virtual-patient-platform
    cd virtual-patient-platform
    ```

2.  **Initialize Git and Connect to Remote:**

    ```bash
    # Initialize the local Git repository
    git init

    # Add the remote repository you created on GitHub
    # Replace the URL with your own
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-platform.git

    # Create a simple README to establish the main branch
    echo "# Virtual Patient Platform" > README.md

    # Stage and commit the README
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"

    # Push to the remote 'main' branch
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

You now have a local folder that is connected to your empty GitHub repository.

---

### **Step 3: Create the Nx Monorepo Structure**

We will use Nx to create a powerful monorepo, pre-configured for NestJS.

1.  **Generate the Workspace:** Run the following command inside your `virtual-patient-platform` folder.

    ```bash
    npx create-nx-workspace@latest . --preset=@nx/nest:monorepo
    ```
    *   When prompted for the **Application name**, type `api`.
    *   When prompted for **Use Nx Cloud?**, you can choose `No` for now (it's free for open-source but not necessary for this project).

This command will set up the entire monorepo structure, including a sample `api` application inside the `apps/` directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate into the newly created `api` app's folder and install the dependencies we need for our authentication system.

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the API app's directory
    cd apps/api

    # Install all necessary packages
    npm install @nestjs/config @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport @prisma/client bcrypt class-transformer class-validator passport passport-jwt passport-local
    npm install --save-dev @types/bcrypt @types/passport-jwt @types/passport-local prisma

    # Navigate back to the root of the monorepo
    cd ../..
    ```

---

### **Step 4: Project 1 - Core API & User Service (Implementation)**

Now we will implement the authentication logic inside the `apps/api` folder.

#### **A. Database Setup with Prisma**

1.  **Initialize Prisma:**
    ```bash
    npx nx g @nx-tools/nx-prisma:init --project=api
    ```
    *(This command uses a community plugin to integrate Prisma nicely into Nx. If it fails, you can manually `cd apps/api` and run `npx prisma init`)*

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Open `apps/api/.env` and add your database URL and JWT secret.

    ```env
    # apps/api/.env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
    ```

3.  **Define the Database Schema:**
    Open `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` and add the `User` and `Role` models.

    ```prisma
    // apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model Role {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      name      String   @unique
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      users     User[]
    }

    model User {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      email     String   @unique
      password  String
      firstName String
      lastName  String
      isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      roleId    Int
      role      Role     @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])
    }
    ```

4.  **Generate Client & Migrate:**
    ```bash
    # Generate Prisma Client
    nx prisma generate api

    # Push schema to database
    npx prisma db push --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
    ```

#### **B. Code Implementation**

1.  **Prisma Service:** The `@nx-tools/nx-prisma:init` command already created `apps/api/src/app/prisma.service.ts`. It's ready to use.

2.  **Auth Module:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the root directory
    npx nx g @nestjs/schematics:module auth --project=api
    npx nx g @nestjs/schematics:service auth --project=api
    npx nx g @nestjs/schematics:controller auth --project=api
    ```
    This creates the `auth` module, service, and controller inside `apps/api/src/app/auth/`.

3.  **Auth Code:** Now, populate the generated files with the code from the previous guide.

    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`** (Create this new file)
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.service.ts`**
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/strategies/local.strategy.ts`** (Create `strategies` folder)
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`**
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`** (Create `guards` folder)
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts`**
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/roles.decorator.ts`** (Create this file in `auth` folder)
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.controller.ts`**
    *   **`apps/api/src/app/auth/auth.module.ts`**

    *(Copy the code for each of these files from the previous response. The paths are the only thing that has changed).*

4.  **Update Main App Module:**
    Open `apps/api/src/app/app.module.ts` and import the `AuthModule`.

    ```typescript
    // apps/api/src/app/app.module.ts
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { AppController } from './app.controller';
    import { AppService } from './app.service';
    import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';
    import { PrismaService } from './prisma.service';

    @Module({
      imports: [AuthModule],
      controllers: [AppController],
      providers: [AppService, PrismaService],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

5.  **Seed Script:**
    Create `apps/api/prisma/seed.ts` and add the seeding code. Then, add the seed script to `apps/api/package.json`.

    ```json
    // apps/api/package.json
    "scripts": {
      // ... other scripts
      "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
    },
    ```
    Run the seed script from the `apps/api` directory:
    ```bash
    cd apps/api
    npm run seed
    cd ../..
    ```

---

### **Step 5: Run, Test, and Push to GitHub**

1.  **Run the API Server:**
    From the **root** of your monorepo, use the Nx command to serve the API application.

    ```bash
    npx nx serve api
    ```
    The API will be running on `http://localhost:3333`.

2.  **Test the Endpoints:**
    Use Postman or `curl` to test the `register`, `login`, and `profile` endpoints on port `3333`.

3.  **Commit and Push Your Work:**
    Now that the first project is complete, commit it to your history and push it to GitHub.

    ```bash
    # Stage all your changes
    git add .

    # Commit with a descriptive message
    git commit -m "feat: Implement Project 1 - Core API & User Service with Auth"

    # Push to the remote repository
    git push origin main
    ```

You have successfully started from scratch, created a professional monorepo, implemented your first project within it, and pushed everything to a remote GitHub repository. You are now perfectly set up to add the next project (e.g., the frontend client) to this same repository.

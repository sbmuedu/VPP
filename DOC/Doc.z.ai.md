2.  **Refine All Projects:** Focus on performance optimization, adding more complex scenarios, improving the AI's emotional intelligence, and comprehensive testing.

# Git init

Of course. Adding source control is the most critical first step before writing any code. It allows you to track changes, revert mistakes, and collaborate with others. We will use Git, which is integrated directly into Visual Studio Code.

Here is a step-by-step guide to initialize a Git repository for your `virtual-patient-api` project.

---

### **Step 1: Prerequisites - Install Git**

If you don't have Git installed, you must install it first.

- **Download Git:** [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). The default settings are usually fine.

To verify the installation, open a terminal (or VS Code's integrated terminal) and type:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see the Git version number printed.

---

### **Step 2: Open Your Project in VS Code**

Make sure you have the `virtual-patient-api` project folder open in VS Code.

---

### **Step 3: Initialize the Git Repository**

1.  Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+` \` (or `Cmd+` \` on Mac) or by going to `Terminal > New Terminal`.

2.  In the terminal, run the following command to initialize a new Git repository in your project folder:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    You will see a message like `Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/your/project/.git/`. This creates a hidden `.git` folder that Git uses to track everything.

---

### **Step 4: Create a `.gitignore` File**

A `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and folders to ignore. This is **essential** to prevent committing sensitive data (like your `.env` file) or unnecessary files (like the `node_modules` folder).

1.  In the VS Code Explorer, create a new file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project.

2.  Add the following content to your `.gitignore` file. This is a standard and robust configuration for a Node.js/NestJS project.

    ```gitignore
    # .gitignore

    # Dependencies
    node_modules/
    npm-debug.log*
    yarn-debug.log*
    yarn-error.log*

    # Environment variables
    .env
    .env.local
    .env.development.local
    .env.test.local
    .env.production.local

    # Build outputs
    dist/
    build/

    # Logs
    logs/
    *.log

    # Runtime data
    pids/
    *.pid
    *.seed
    *.pid.lock

    # Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
    coverage/
    *.lcov

    # nyc test coverage
    .nyc_output/

    # Dependency directories
    jspm_packages/

    # Optional npm cache directory
    .npm

    # Optional REPL history
    .node_repl_history

    # Output of 'npm pack'
    *.tgz

    # Yarn Integrity file
    .yarn-integrity

    # dotenv environment variables file
    .env

    # parcel-bundler cache (https://parceljs.org/)
    .cache
    .parcel-cache

    # next.js build output
    .next

    # nuxt.js build output
    .nuxt

    # vuepress build output
    .vuepress/dist

    # Serverless directories
    .serverless

    # FuseBox cache
    .fusebox/

    # DynamoDB Local files
    .dynamodb/

    # TernJS port file
    .tern-port

    # Stores VSCode versions used for testing VSCode extensions
    .vscode-test
    ```

---

### **Step 5: Add Files and Make Your First Commit**

Now we will tell Git to track all the files (except those in `.gitignore`) and save this as the first version of our project.

1.  **Check the Source Control View:** Go to the Source Control icon in the VS Code Activity Bar (on the left). You will see a list of "Changes" – all the files you've created are listed under "U" (Untracked).

2.  **Stage the Changes:** You can stage all changes by clicking the **"+"** icon next to "Changes" at the top of the Source Control panel. This moves all the files to the "Staged Changes" area.

3.  **Commit the Staged Changes:**
    - Type a clear and concise commit message in the "Message" box. A good first message is `Initial commit: Project 1 - Core API & User Service`.
    - Click the **checkmark icon** (✓) at the top of the Source Control panel to create the commit.

    Alternatively, you can do this from the terminal:

    ```bash
    # Stage all files
    git add .

    # Commit with a message
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Project 1 - Core API & User Service"
    ```

---

### **Step 6: (Optional but Highly Recommended) Connect to a Remote Repository**

Storing your code on a remote service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket provides a backup and makes collaboration easy.

1.  **Create a Remote Repository:** Go to your preferred Git hosting service (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com)) and create a new, empty repository. Do **not** initialize it with a README, license, or `.gitignore`, as we already have those locally. Copy the repository's URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-api.git`).

2.  **Add the Remote Origin:** In the VS Code terminal, run the following command, replacing the URL with your own:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/virtual-patient-api.git
    ```

3.  **Push to the Remote:** Push your local commits to the remote repository. The `-u` flag sets your local branch to track the remote `main` branch.

    ```bash
    # First, rename your branch to 'main' if it's 'master'
    git branch -M main

    # Push the commits
    git push -u origin main
    ```

You may be prompted to enter your username and password (or a Personal Access Token) for the Git service.

---

### **Verification**

Your project is now fully under source control!

- In VS Code, the "Source Control" panel should now show "No Changes".
- You can check your commit history by opening the terminal and typing `git log --oneline`.
- You can visit your repository on GitHub/GitLab to see your code there.

You are now ready to proceed with confidence. Every change you make from this point on can be tracked, committed, and pushed to your remote repository. We can now safely move on to the next development phase.

# Project 1: Core API & User Service

Of course. This is an extensive undertaking, so we will proceed step-by-step, starting with the foundational project. We will build **Project 1: Core API & User Service** from the ground up.

This first project will establish the entire backend foundation, including the database schema, user authentication, and role-based access control. I will provide the full code, documentation, and instructions for running it.

---

## **Project 1: Core API & User Service**

### **Objective**

Create a secure, scalable, and well-documented REST API using NestJS. This service will handle user registration, login, role management, and provide the base structure for all future modules.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Framework:** Nest.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Validation:** `class-validator` and `class-transformer`

---

### **Step 1: Project Setup & Installation**

First, let's create a new NestJS project and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Install NestJS CLI globally
npm install -g @nestjs/cli

# Create a new project named 'virtual-patient-api'
nest new virtual-patient-api

# Navigate into the project directory
cd virtual-patient-api

# Install required dependencies
npm install @nestjs/config @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport @prisma/client bcrypt class-transformer class-validator passport passport-jwt passport-local
npm install --save-dev @types/bcrypt @types/passport-jwt @types/passport-local prisma
```

---

### **Step 2: Database Setup with Prisma**

1.  **Initialize Prisma:**

    ```bash
    npx prisma init
    ```

    This creates a `prisma` directory and a `.env` file.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Open the `.env` file and add your database connection string and a JWT secret.

    ```env
    # .env
    # Replace with your actual PostgreSQL connection string
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"

    # A strong secret for signing JWTs
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
    ```

3.  **Define the Database Schema:**
    Open `prisma/schema.prisma` and replace its content with the following. This defines our `User` and `Role` models.

    ```prisma
    // prisma/schema.prisma

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model Role {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      name      String   @unique // e.g., "student", "supervisor", "admin"
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      users     User[]
    }

    model User {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      email     String   @unique
      password  String   // Hashed password
      firstName String
      lastName  String
      isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      roleId    Int
      role      Role     @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])
    }
    ```

4.  **Generate Prisma Client & Migrate Database:**

    ```bash
    # Generate the Prisma Client (TypeScript types for your database)
    npx prisma generate

    # Push the schema to the database (creates tables)
    # For development, 'db push' is fine. For production, use 'migrate dev'
    npx prisma db push
    ```

---

### **Step 3: Code Implementation**

Now, let's create the necessary modules, services, and controllers.

#### **A. Prisma Service (Database Connection)**

Create a dedicated service to provide an instance of the Prisma Client.

```bash
nest generate service prisma
```

**`src/prisma/prisma.service.ts`**

```typescript
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from "@nestjs/common";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

@Injectable()
export class PrismaService extends PrismaClient implements OnModuleInit {
  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.$connect();
  }
}
```

#### **B. Authentication Module**

This module will handle user registration, login, and JWT strategy.

```bash
nest generate module auth
nest generate service auth
nest generate controller auth
```

**`src/auth/auth.module.ts`**

```typescript
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";
import { AuthController } from "./auth.controller";
import { PrismaService } from "../prisma/prisma.service";
import { JwtModule } from "@nestjs/jwt";
import { PassportModule } from "@nestjs/passport";
import { ConfigModule, ConfigService } from "@nestjs/config";
import { LocalStrategy } from "./strategies/local.strategy";
import { JwtStrategy } from "./strategies/jwt.strategy";

@Module({
  imports: [
    PassportModule,
    JwtModule.registerAsync({
      imports: [ConfigModule],
      useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
        secret: configService.get<string>("JWT_SECRET"),
        signOptions: { expiresIn: "1d" },
      }),
      inject: [ConfigService],
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AuthController],
  providers: [AuthService, PrismaService, LocalStrategy, JwtStrategy],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

**`src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`**

```typescript
import { IsEmail, IsString, MinLength, IsOptional } from "class-validator";

export class RegisterDto {
  @IsEmail()
  email: string;

  @IsString()
  @MinLength(6)
  password: string;

  @IsString()
  firstName: string;

  @IsString()
  lastName: string;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsString()
  roleName?: string; // e.g., 'student'
}
```

**`src/auth/auth.service.ts`**

```typescript
import {
  Injectable,
  UnauthorizedException,
  ConflictException,
} from "@nestjs/common";
import { JwtService } from "@nestjs/jwt";
import { PrismaService } from "../prisma/prisma.service";
import * as bcrypt from "bcrypt";
import { RegisterDto } from "./dto/register.dto";

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(
    private prisma: PrismaService,
    private jwtService: JwtService,
  ) {}

  async validateUser(email: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { email },
      include: { role: true },
    });
    if (user && (await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password))) {
      // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
      const { password, ...result } = user;
      return result;
    }
    return null;
  }

  async login(user: any) {
    const payload = { email: user.email, sub: user.id, role: user.role.name };
    return {
      access_token: this.jwtService.sign(payload),
      user: {
        id: user.id,
        email: user.email,
        firstName: user.firstName,
        lastName: user.lastName,
        role: user.role.name,
      },
    };
  }

  async register(registerDto: RegisterDto) {
    const {
      email,
      password,
      firstName,
      lastName,
      roleName = "student",
    } = registerDto;

    const existingUser = await this.prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { email },
    });
    if (existingUser) {
      throw new ConflictException("Email already in use");
    }

    const role = await this.prisma.role.findUnique({
      where: { name: roleName },
    });
    if (!role) {
      throw new ConflictException(`Role '${roleName}' not found`);
    }

    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

    const user = await this.prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email,
        password: hashedPassword,
        firstName,
        lastName,
        roleId: role.id,
      },
      include: { role: true },
    });

    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
    const { password: _, ...result } = user;
    return result;
  }
}
```

**JWT & Local Strategies**
Create a `strategies` folder inside `src/auth`.

**`src/auth/strategies/local.strategy.ts`**

```typescript
import { Strategy } from "passport-local";
import { PassportStrategy } from "@nestjs/passport";
import { Injectable, UnauthorizedException } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthService } from "../auth.service";

@Injectable()
export class LocalStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {
    super({ usernameField: "email" }); // Use email as username
  }

  async validate(email: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.authService.validateUser(email, password);
    if (!user) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return user;
  }
}
```

**`src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`**

```typescript
import { ExtractJwt, Strategy } from "passport-jwt";
import { PassportStrategy } from "@nestjs/passport";
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ConfigService } from "@nestjs/config";

@Injectable()
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {
    super({
      jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
      ignoreExpiration: false,
      secretOrKey: configService.get<string>("JWT_SECRET"),
    });
  }

  async validate(payload: any) {
    return { userId: payload.sub, email: payload.email, role: payload.role };
  }
}
```

**Guards**
Create a `guards` folder inside `src/auth`.

**`src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`**

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthGuard } from "@nestjs/passport";

@Injectable()
export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard("jwt") {}
```

**`src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts`**

```typescript
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Reflector } from "@nestjs/core";

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private reflector: Reflector) {}

  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const requiredRoles = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride<string[]>("roles", [
      context.getHandler(),
      context.getClass(),
    ]);
    if (!requiredRoles) {
      return true;
    }
    const { user } = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return requiredRoles.some((role) => user.role === role);
  }
}
```

**Roles Decorator**
Create this in the `src/auth` directory.

**`src/auth/roles.decorator.ts`**

```typescript
import { SetMetadata } from "@nestjs/common";

export const ROLES_KEY = "roles";
export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata(ROLES_KEY, roles);
```

**`src/auth/auth.controller.ts`**

```typescript
import {
  Controller,
  Post,
  Body,
  UseGuards,
  Request,
  Get,
} from "@nestjs/common";
import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";
import { RegisterDto } from "./dto/register.dto";
import { LocalAuthGuard } from "./guards/local-auth.guard";
import { JwtAuthGuard } from "./guards/jwt-auth.guard";
import { Roles } from "./roles.decorator";
import { RolesGuard } from "./guards/roles.guard";

@Controller("auth")
export class AuthController {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {}

  @Post("register")
  async register(@Body() registerDto: RegisterDto) {
    return this.authService.register(registerDto);
  }

  @UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
  @Post("login")
  async login(@Request() req) {
    return this.authService.login(req.user);
  }

  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  @Get("profile")
  getProfile(@Request() req) {
    return req.user;
  }

  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
  @Roles("admin", "supervisor")
  @Get("admin/dashboard")
  getAdminDashboard() {
    return { message: "Welcome to the admin dashboard!" };
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Main App Module & Seeding**

1.  **Update `app.module.ts`:**
    Make sure `ConfigModule` is available globally and that our `AuthModule` is imported.

    **`src/app.module.ts`**

    ```typescript
    import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
    import { ConfigModule } from "@nestjs/config";
    import { AuthModule } from "./auth/auth.module";
    import { PrismaService } from "./prisma/prisma.service";

    @Module({
      imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true }), AuthModule],
      providers: [PrismaService],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

2.  **Create a Seed Script:**
    We need to create default roles in our database.

    **`prisma/seed.ts`**

    ```typescript
    import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

    const prisma = new PrismaClient();

    async function main() {
      console.log("Start seeding...");

      const studentRole = await prisma.role.upsert({
        where: { name: "student" },
        update: {},
        create: {
          name: "student",
        },
      });

      const supervisorRole = await prisma.role.upsert({
        where: { name: "supervisor" },
        update: {},
        create: {
          name: "supervisor",
        },
      });

      const adminRole = await prisma.role.upsert({
        where: { name: "admin" },
        update: {},
        create: {
          name: "admin",
        },
      });

      console.log({ studentRole, supervisorRole, adminRole });
      console.log("Seeding finished.");
    }

    main()
      .catch((e) => {
        console.error(e);
        process.exit(1);
      })
      .finally(async () => {
        await prisma.$disconnect();
      });
    ```

3.  **Add Seed Script to `package.json`:**

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      // ... other scripts
      "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
    },
    ```

    You may need to install `ts-node` as a dev dependency: `npm install --save-dev ts-node`.

4.  **Run the Seed Script:**
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

---

### **Step 5: Running and Testing the API**

1.  **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    The API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Test with a Tool like Postman or `curl`:**

    **A. Register a new user:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "email": "student1@example.com",
      "password": "password123",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "roleName": "student"
    }'
    ```

    **B. Login to get a JWT:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "email": "student1@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }'
    ```

    Copy the `access_token` from the response.

    **C. Access a protected route:**
    Replace `YOUR_JWT_TOKEN` with the token you copied.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/auth/profile \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
    ```

    **D. Test a role-protected route (should fail for 'student' role):**

    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/auth/admin/dashboard \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
    ```

    This should return a `403 Forbidden` error.

### **Mocking for Frontend Testing**

Even before building the frontend (Project 7), you can test this API. A frontend developer can use tools like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or even write a simple script using `fetch` to interact with these endpoints.

For a more integrated mock experience, a frontend developer could use a library like **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**. They would build their UI components and configure MSW to intercept API calls. Initially, MSW would return **mocked JSON responses**. Once the real API is ready, they can simply turn off the mock and point their app to the live `http://localhost:3000` backend without changing any of their frontend code.

**Example Mocked Response for `/auth/profile`:**

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "email": "student1@example.com",
  "role": "student"
}
```

This completes **Project 1**. We now have a secure, documented, and tested backend foundation for user management and authentication.

### **Next Steps**

With Project 1 complete, we can now proceed in parallel or sequentially:

1.  **Start Project 2 (Medical Knowledge Base Service):** Add new modules and Prisma models for drugs, procedures, etc., to this existing codebase.
2.  **Start Project 7 (Web Client Shell):** A frontend developer can begin building the login/registration pages and the main dashboard, using our live API or MSW mocks.
